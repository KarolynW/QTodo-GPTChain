Yes, the source for the world's most over-engineered to-do list lives here.
Because nothing says "stay organized" like React, Vite, Tailwind and a mild
identity crisis.

## Features

- Tasks are lovingly transmogrified into enigmatic haiku by the OpenAI API.
- Daily quantum random shuffling keeps you guessing which chore comes next.
- A blinking ASCII banner to prove we care more about aesthetics than usefulness.
- LocalStorage persistence so your confusion survives every refresh.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment if you actually want the AI to
rewrite your tasks. Otherwise, enjoy plain text like it's 1999.
